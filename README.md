# MIPS Softcore

A minimal MIPS III (R4000) softcore in (System)Verilog

Goal is to have a relatively perfomant MIPS core compatible with the MIPS III instruction set
as used in the SGI Indy workstations and the Nintendo 64 console.

This is still a work in progress. I am still learning Verilog, so the code might include mistakes.
Any feedback an/or improvements would be appreciated.
